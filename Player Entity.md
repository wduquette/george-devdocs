# Player Entity
#doc 

A player entity is a [[Mobile Entity]] representing a player-controlled character.  Every player entity has a `Player` component along with the other standard components.

- At present (2021-12-21), the `Player` component is just a marker used to identify George.  Eventually we'll have more than one, and there will be other associated data.
