# README â€” george-devdocs

This repository contains the development notes for [George's Saga](https://github.com/wduquette/george).  Throughout, "Old George" refers to the 2013 app, written using Swing; and "New George" refers to the current app.

It is in a separate repository because development notes span branches.  These are working notes, not finished code; page content often reflects early design rather than finished code. This repository is also an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md), which makes editing much easier.
