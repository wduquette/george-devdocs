# Sprite
#component 

A `Sprite` has an image and a (x,y) pixel offset to the entity's cell location.  It controls how an entity is rendered by the rendering system.

## Open Questions

It might sometimes be convenient to have a sprite with absolute rather than cell-relative pixel coordinates, e.g., for [[VisualEffect]] entities.
