# 2021-12-12

- Fixed bug in the `KeywordParser`
	- It parsed blocks, but didn't actually accumulate the block content.
- Revised `Step.MoveTo`.
	- It now works like `Step.Trigger`, replanning the route after each step.
- How to display signs?
	- Interrupts.
	- The App maintains an Interrupt stack.
	- Some systems can return Interrupts.
	- When an Interrupt is returned, the `gameLoop()` returns.
	- If there is an Interrupt on the stack, the `gameLoop()` handles it and returns.
	- We will have an Interrupt.DisplaySign.
	- Other Interrupts can display the player status, switch to a different region, handle player death.
- Added `UserInput` sealed type, revised MapViewer to produce `UserInputs`
	- One variant, `UserInput.CellClick`
	- `CellClickEvent` is now `UserInputEvent`.
- Added `UserInput.StatusBox`
	- Planner outputs a log message for this.
- Added `Interrupt` and the application interrupt stack.
	- `Interrupt.WaitForInput`
	- `Interrupt.DisplaySign`
- George can now wander about and click on signs.
