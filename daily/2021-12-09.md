# 2021-12-09

- Added a new `Loc` component, which combines a `Cell` with a row and column offset,
	- And removed the row and column offset from `Cell`
	- The code runs, but the animation isn't right: George moves repeatedly from his starting point.  (Fixed)
	- Problem is that I can put any object I like into the entity.  I need to limit it to actual components.
- Added a Component interface, and revised Entity and EntityTable to require it.
