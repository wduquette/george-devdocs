- Entity IDs
	- Are now global, assigned by Entity, independent of the EntityTable.
	- This allows entities to be trivially moved from one region to another.
- Added log messages
	- Created using `Region::log`
	- "Animated" by the [[Animator System]]
		- Assigns a `lastTick` based on the intended message duration.
		- Removes log messages that are too old.
		- Limits the total number
	- Rendered by the [[Rendering System]].
- Added a couple of log messages to the Planner.
- Added a button bar with Pointer and Magnifier buttons.
	- When Pointer is selected, clicking moves and interacts.
	- When Magnifier is selected, a description is displayed.
- Descriptions
	- Are currently awful, for everything but terrain.
	- There should be a Terrain component for the TerrainType.
	- Feature should have a name instead of a terrain type.
	- Mobile and Feature names should be descriptive.
- Defined Terrain component
- Gave Features names
- Centralized the `Door` appearance logic in one place.
- Thoughts on [[Mobile Behavior Modeling]]
