- Completed the sprite changes I started yesterday.
	- The renderer in GameView gets sprites from Sprites.ALL by name, and terrain tiles from its own terrain tile set.
	- We are not quite at the point, consequently, that I could just swap the sprite set to one of a different size; it's necessary to update the region tile sets as well.
		- But, I could define two tile sets for each region, reference both in the `.region` file, and let the region load one or the other based on a constructor argument, or swap between them as needed.
- Next steps:
	- Moving between regions
	- Doors.  `Door(closedSprite,openSprite)`, and eventually adding in a condition name.
