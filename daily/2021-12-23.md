- [[Entity Schema]]
	- `id` should always refer to an entity ID.
	- `key` should always refer to a key or key prefix into the game info table.
		- Probably need to globalize the info table.
- Questions
	- Some things have a `name` used for lookups.  
		- It's a component-specific name
		- It isn't an `id`
		- It isn't a `key`
	- Should I define a `Label` property?
		- Probably
	- Should display names always be read from the strings table?
	- Should I have another name for the strings table?
		- Yes. It's more of a static key/value store of game data 
- Decisions
	- Component parameters should be named as described in the [[Entity Schema]].
	- Define a `Label` property for display labels, instead of duplicating that in multiple components
	- The StringsTable should be a KeyDataFile, `.data`
	- The StringsTable for the app should be the "game info" table.
	- Entities defined in Tiled object groups that need other data should have an info key
		- Other data should be defined in the game info table, not in Tiled object properties.
