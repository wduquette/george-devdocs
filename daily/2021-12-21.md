- Debugger!
	- Implemented the Debugger window!
	- Pops up on F1.
	- Shows live view of the entities table, with filtering.
		- Updated twice a second.
	- Can click on any entity with a `Loc` to move party to that cell.
	- "Go To" menu
		- Shows all points and exits in the current region and will magically transfer the party there.
	- Utterly cool!
